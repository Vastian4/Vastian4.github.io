## Data introduction


## History of drug related crimes in SF

San Francisco has a long track record of struggle against drug crime. Historically, 
abuse of pain killers such as OxyContin has been a big problem in SF, both as a cause 
for addiction in itself, but also as a path towards even more hardcore drugs, such as 
heroin. In 2017, a study showed that 80% of heroin users reported beginning with 
prescription opiods [[1]](https://www.sfpublicpress.org/san-franciscos-fatal-overdose-crisis-was-decades-in-the-making/).
In recent years, the use of fentanyl as seen a huge increase, especially among the homeless 
population of SF. Figure 1 shows the change in the number of drug related crime incidents 
throughout the years [[2]](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/05/427651/smoking-fentanyl-rising-sf-deadly-new-risk-overdose#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20reached%20an%20all,cocaine%2C%20are%20on%20the%20rise.).

## Drug related crime trends by district

As with many other types of crime, drug related crime does not usually distribute evenly over large cities.
In general, there exist certain indicators that typically go hand in hand with large amounts of drug activity.
These are things such as poverty level and homelessness. Tenderloin is the district of SF with the highest 
level of homelessness and is in general known for its prevalence of social issues [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderloin,_San_Francisco).
In figure 2, we illustrate the distribution of drug related crimes throughout SF.
