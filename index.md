## History of drug related crimes in SF

San Francisco has a long track record of struggle against drug crime. Historically, 
abuse of pain killers such as OxyContin has been a big problem in SF, both as a cause 
for addiction in itself, but also as a path towards even more hardcore drugs, such as 
heroin. In 2017, a study showed that 80% of heroin users reported beginning with 
prescription opiods [[1]](https://www.sfpublicpress.org/san-franciscos-fatal-overdose-crisis-was-decades-in-the-making/).
In recent years, the use of fentanyl as seen a huge increase, especially among the homeless 
population of SF. Figure 1 shows the change in the number of drug related crime incidents 
throughout the years.
